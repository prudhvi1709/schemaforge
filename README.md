- **DBT Rules Generation**: Complete DBT models, tests, and configurations
- **Interactive UI**: Clean, responsive interface with tabbed results view
- **Export Capabilities**: Download generated schemas and rules as structured JSON files
- **Entity Relationship Diagrams**: Interactive visualization of database schemas and relationships

### Advanced Features

- **Chat Interface**: Interactive Q&A about your data and schema
- **Real-time Processing**: Live status updates during file processing
- **Privacy-aware Analysis**: Column descriptions include privacy indicators
- **Multiple LLM Providers**: Support for OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama, and custom APIs
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time streaming of LLM outputs as they're generated
- **Interactive ER Diagrams**: Drag-and-drop entity relationship diagrams with GoJS

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application is built with:

- **Frontend**: Modern ES6 modules with Bootstrap 5 UI
- **File Processing**: Client-side CSV/Excel parsing with XLSX library
- **LLM Integration**: `bootstrap-llm-provider` for flexible API configuration
- **Streaming**: `asyncLLM` for real-time streaming of LLM responses
- **JSON Handling**: `partial-json` for parsing incomplete JSON during streaming
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns across focused JavaScript modules
- **Visualization**: GoJS library for interactive entity relationship diagrams

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser with ES6 module support
- LLM API access (OpenAI, OpenRouter, or compatible provider)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd schemaforge
   ```

2. **Open the application**

   ```bash
   # Serve locally (recommended)
   python -m http.server 8000
   # Then open http://localhost:8000

   # Or open directly in browser
   open index.html
   ```

3. **Configure LLM Provider**
   - Click "Configure LLM Provider" in the interface
   - Enter your API key and select a provider
   - Supported providers:
     - OpenAI (`https://api.openai.com/v1`)
     - OpenRouter (`https://openrouter.com/api/v1`)
     - Ollama (`http://localhost:11434/v1`)
     - Any OpenAI-compatible API

## üìã Usage Guide

### Step 1: Upload Your Data

- Select a CSV or Excel file using the file upload section
- Files with multiple sheets are automatically detected and processed
- Supported formats: `.csv`, `.xlsx`

### Step 2: Schema Generation

- The application automatically extracts headers and sample data
- LLM analyzes the structure and generates comprehensive schema information
- View results in the "Schema Overview" tab
- **Real-time streaming**: Watch as schema information appears incrementally

### Step 3: Column Analysis

- Review detailed column descriptions in the "Column Descriptions" tab
- Privacy indicators help identify sensitive data fields
- Inferred data types and metadata are displayed

### Step 4: Visualize Entity Relationships

- Navigate to the "ER Diagram" tab to see an interactive visualization
- Tables are shown as nodes with their columns listed
- Relationships between tables are displayed as connecting links
- Drag nodes to rearrange the diagram for better visualization
- Use zoom controls to focus on specific parts of the schema
- Primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK) are clearly marked

### Step 5: DBT Rules

- Click "Generate DBT Rules" to create DBT configurations
- Watch as rules stream in real-time to the "DBT Rules" tab
- Includes models, tests, and data quality configurations
- Production-ready YAML and SQL code

### Step 6: Interactive Chat

- Use the chat interface to ask questions about your data
- Request modifications to the generated DBT rules
- Perform exploratory data analysis through natural language
- **Streaming responses**: See the assistant's responses appear in real-time

### Step 7: Export Results

- Download the complete analysis as a structured JSON file
- Includes schema, column descriptions, and DBT configurations

## üîß Technical Implementation

### LLM Integration

The application uses a two-stage LLM process:

1. **Schema Generation**: Analyzes file structure and sample data to create comprehensive schema
2. **DBT Rules Generation**: Transforms schema into production-ready DBT configurations

### Entity Relationship Diagram

The application uses GoJS to create interactive entity relationship diagrams that dynamically visualize:

- Tables as nodes with expandable column lists
- Relationships between tables as connecting links
- Primary and foreign keys with clear visual indicators
- Automatic layout with force-directed positioning

### Streaming Implementation

The application implements real-time streaming of LLM responses to provide immediate feedback during processing. This enables:

- Progressive rendering of schema information as it's generated
- Live updates to the UI during lengthy operations
- Improved user experience with visual feedback

### Supported LLM Providers

The application is designed to work with multiple LLM providers through a flexible configuration system:

- OpenAI API
- OpenRouter
- Ollama (local deployment)
- Any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint

### File Processing

- **CSV**: Native JavaScript parsing with automatic delimiter detection
- **Excel**: XLSX library for multi-sheet support
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for malformed files

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Data Engineers**: Generate DBT boilerplate for new data sources
- **Analytics Teams**: Quick schema documentation and data quality rules
- **Data Scientists**: Understand data structure before analysis
- **Consultants**: Rapid data assessment and documentation
- **Database Designers**: Visualize and refine database schemas

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Code Style

- ES6 modules with modern JavaScript features
- Functional programming approach (no classes)
- Bootstrap 5 for styling (no custom CSS)
- Modular architecture with single responsibility principle

### Linting

```bash
# Format JavaScript and Markdown
npx prettier@3.5 --print-width=120 '**/*.js' '**/*.md'

# Format HTML
